Home Page / Landing
 ~~ Both have poor stylings for smaller width's
 ~~ Need three new images displayed, with corresponding descriptions
 ~~ Need a "Download the Data" option
 ~~ Whole new section titled "Systemic Disparity Insights"
 ~~ Section contains three metrics, preceded be explanations of what the metrics mean
 ~~ Read more link
 ~~ Same links are broken on the footer

 Graphs Page
 ~~ Both have poor stylings for smaller width's
 ~~ Concurrent bug with the zoom in and zoom out being... too effective, I guess
 ~~ Need to bring in the data to be used. Probably a local source.
 ~~ Should maybe make the list at the bottom an expandable object
 ~~ Heat maps don't change despite being different cities. Intentional?
 ~~ When using the selected zoom tool, it pop-ups a "double click to zoom back out". I think this should be a concurrent thing that lingers, cus people can miss/forget
 ~~ Box select and lasso select seem to only work on the map, they shouldn't appear on the graph section(time series).
 ~~ Reset either doesn't work or doesn't work like how I expect it to, aka it might be doing something else I'm not seeing
 ~~ I have no idea what the Query box's do, if anything
