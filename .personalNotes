 ~~ Header in main needs styling re-adjustments

Graphs Page
 ~~ Page breaks at 1025px width

 ~~ Others might work, need data to check

 \/\/\/\/\/ Comparing the Projects \/\/\/\/\/

Home Page / Landing
 ~~ Both have poor stylings for smaller width's
 ~~ Need three new images displayed, with corresponding descriptions
 ~~ Need a "Download the Data" option
 ~~ Whole new section titled "Systemic Disparity Insights"
 ~~ Section contains three metrics, preceded be explanations of what the metrics mean
 ~~ Read more link
 ~~ Same links are broken on the footer

 Graphs Page
 ~~ Both have poor stylings for smaller width's
 ~~ Concurrent bug with the zoom in and zoom out being... too effective, I guess
 ~~ Need to bring in the data to be used. Probably a local source.
 ~~ Should maybe make the list at the bottom an expandable object
 ~~ Heat maps don't change despite being different cities. Intentional?
 ~~ When using the selected zoom tool, it pop-ups a "double click to zoom back out". I think this should be a concurrent thing that lingers, cus people can miss/forget
 ~~ Box select and lasso select seem to only work on the map, they shouldn't appear on the graph section(time series).
 ~~ Reset either doesn't work or doesn't work like how I expect it to, aka it might be doing something else I'm not seeing
 ~~ I have no idea what the Query box's do, if anything
 ~~ Styling on box's is not the same width, looks ugly.


 First Ticket TODOS:
    ~ When conforming to smaller devices, I should minimize all the images and content, as well as the text, into a slideshow type of thing. I think that would be a fun thing to do and also LEARN how to do.
    ~ Fix the page breaks.
    ~ Possibly remove the broken links; only issue is they might be tied to unit tests.
    ~ It would be nice to link of the metrics that are displayed to actual requests from, say, an api, but I don't 1. Know if its an api source or 2. if so, what api?
    ~ Add the download the Data button. IDK what its gonna download(or how TO download)
    ~ Make the styling a bit more reactive; There ARE some hover elements, but they are few and far inbetween. Also, I can add some bolding to some of the lines to really make it readable.
    ~ cont. What do I mean by readable? Well, I still haven't read the resource, and I've looked at this page like 5 seperate times. It's hard to grab my attention.
    ~ cont 2. I should remember what it taught me and not go overboard, this is a corporate site, I should treat it like one.
    ~ In the big text blob, we can include links to the literal places its talking about, they are their own... {/place} things, you know what I mean?
    ~ Back to top DEFINITELY needs styling.
